            <p class="secuityConsiderations"><b>Security Considerations</b></p>
            <!--Security consideration section-->
            <p>There is a range of many difference methods a hacker can use to attack a webpage. Hackers aim to take data from a webpage or even just to take it offline. Web pages could use a multi-layer secuirty defense. This closes all the ports to the webpage that is in use. An intruder detection system can also be used
                which will detect suspicious activity on the system which may be caused by someone attacking the system. Webpages should also use a secure socket layer (ssl). This protects the data as it is passed over the internet. A SSL is active when a padlock system appears in the URL box. Passwords that are kept on a database should be encrypted so any hackers would get a encrypted version instead.
                Staff should also be trained for awareness and prevention to reduce the chance of a successful attack on the company website. </p>
            <p>The most common attacks to the webpages are: Input Validation, SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting and Directory traversal. Input validation is when data sent is unexpected which could be to take the webpage offline. SQL Injection is when additional SQL is entered which could then return the different tables and columns on the database that the webpage is using. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
                is unwanted code such as Javascript being entered into the webpage. This could be a cookie or a simple malicious message box. This could then track what the user is doing with their PC after visiting the webpage. Directory traversal
                is when a hacker uses software on the web server to get the directories and files which they could then take offline. The risk of this can be reduced by careful web server programming and install new software patches when released.
                Data should always be sanitise before entered so make sure it is valid and prepared statements can be used to hide the columns in a database from hackers. </p>
